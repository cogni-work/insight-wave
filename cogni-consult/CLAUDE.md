# cogni-consult Development Guide

## Identity

cogni-consult is a consulting engagement orchestrator for the insight-wave ecosystem built on three structural bets: **action fields are the work-breakdown-structure containers** for every deliverable (no fixed phase folders), **each deliverable runs its own design-thinking loop** (empathize→define→ideate→prototype→test), and **cogni-knowledge is the central research tool** bound once per engagement and compounding across all deliverables. It was selected after a side-by-side dogfood evaluation of two consulting-orchestration approaches (record: `docs/contributing/cogni-consult-evaluation.md`).

## Design Principles

- **Action fields as WBS** — scoping derives 3-6 action fields from the key question; every deliverable lives inside exactly one field. Progress is tracked per deliverable, not per global phase
- **Design thinking per deliverable** — each deliverable iterates empathize→define→ideate→prototype→test on its own clock; fields complete when their deliverables do
- **Acting personas as a seed-from-scope gate** — stakeholder personas are seeded from the engagement scope *before* the first design-thinking deliverable can start, then actively challenge deliverable work in their voice (not just describe users). The seed is a gate, not a suggestion: `consult-design-thinking` hard-blocks a not-started deliverable and `consult-resume` routes to persona-seeding first, until the gate is satisfied. The two shipped setup-default advisors (consulting partner, project manager; `source: setup-default`) do **not** satisfy it. The gate is the derived `personas_gate` rollup: **satisfied** when any `personas/*.json` carries `source: scope-seeded` **or** the extensionless `personas/.gate-waiver` marker is present, else **pending**. The waiver is the defaults-only escape — when no external stakeholders are worth modelling, `consult-personas` (mode: waive) writes `.gate-waiver` on explicit confirmation, moving the gate to satisfied without seeding a persona
- **Knowledge base as the research spine** — one cogni-knowledge base bound at setup (`plugin_refs.knowledge_base`); all deliverable research runs through it and compounds
- **Orchestrator, not producer** — manages engagement state; content work dispatches to existing plugins
- **Read-only fan-out agents, single write owner** — parallelizable per-item judgment (Test-stage persona challenge, Empathize empathy-mapping, Test-gate framework-adherence review) is delegated to read-only agents that return `{success, data, error}` envelopes; the orchestrating skill merges the envelopes and owns every write. The persona-challenge write contract lives in exactly one place (consult-personas' challenge mode); the DT loop delegates instead of reimplementing. Together with structural validation and the persona challenge, the advisory adherence review completes the repo's Three-Layer Quality Gate; all gates are advisory — auto-walk never deadlocks. Dense fan-out/merge/idempotency contracts live in `references/orchestration/`, keeping the SKILL body under the 500-line cap
- **Path references, not data copies** — cross-references via slugs/paths, no shared DB
- **Voice in the output style, phase discipline in the skills** — the always-on executive-advisory *voice* lives in the `output-styles/strategy-advisor.md` output style (opt-in, fixed at session start); the diverge/converge *phase discipline* stays in the consult-* skills, which load contextually so they never fire outside an active engagement

## Data Model

Each engagement lives in `cogni-consult/{slug}/` with:
- `consult-project.json` — engagement config, key question, action-field list, scope state, plugin refs
- `assumptions.json` — single source of truth for assumption values; deliverables and briefs cite them as `{{asm:id}}` placeholders resolved at publish time by `resolve-assumptions.py`
- `scope/` — key question + 5 scoping dimensions + derived action-field list
- `action-fields/{field-slug}/` — one directory per WBS field: `field.json` (single source of truth for the field's deliverable states) + deliverable markdown artifacts
- `personas/` — acting stakeholder personas (JSON)
- `sources/` — engagement source inbox: the documented drop location for raw material (LOI, specs, notes, transcripts) to ground a deliverable; scaffolded at setup with a `README.md`, the Empathize stage ingests it into the bound base or reads it into a deliverable's `sources[]`
- `.metadata/` — execution-log, method-log, decision-log (all addressed by `action_field` + `deliverable`)

Full schemas: `references/data-model.md`.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `engagement-init.sh` | Create the engagement directory skeleton + consult-project.json, then write the engagement-root `README.md` front door via `generate-engagement-readme.py` (final step, non-fatal — a generator failure degrades to a stderr warning) |
| `engagement-status.sh` | Read consult-project.json + derive field/deliverable rollups from `field.json` files, plus the `personas_gate` rollup (satisfied when a `personas/*.json` has `source: scope-seeded` or the extensionless `personas/.gate-waiver` marker is present, else pending) → JSON |
| `generate-engagement-readme.py` | Write the Obsidian-browsable `README.md` front door at the engagement root from the same read model (key question, status snapshot, single next recommended deliverable incl. the `personas_gate` rung, wayfinding links that only target existing files); read-only except the `README.md` it writes. Invoked at scaffold time by `engagement-init.sh` and, unconditionally and non-fatally, at the dashboard milestones — `consult-design-thinking` (session close), `consult-action-fields` (WBS change), `consult-resume` (re-entry) — the markdown parallel to `consult-dashboard-refresher`'s theme-gated HTML refresh |
| `deliverable-graph.py` | Deliverable dependency-graph engine over all `field.json` files: `validate` (cycles + dangling refs), `trace` (upstream lineage), `impact` (downstream blast radius), `refresh-order` (topological layering of stale deliverables), `schedule` (duration-weighted earliest-start/finish + critical path over `depends_on[]`), `cascade-stale` (flag downstream `lineage_status` via idempotent RMW). Full model: `references/dependency-model.md` |
| `resolve-assumptions.py` | Render-time resolver replacing `{{asm:<slug>}}` placeholders with values from the engagement-root `assumptions.json` registry (single source of truth for assumption values). Fail-loud on unresolvable placeholders; wired into `consult-publish` as the mandatory post-build/pre-lineage pass (contract: `references/publish-routing.md`). A cited claim-type assumption at `verified` is evidence-gated: its `citation.claim_id` must resolve to a verified ClaimRecord in the workspace `cogni-claims/claims.json` (read-only; `--claims-file` overrides the location), else the resolve fails loud |
| `submit-assumption-claim.py` | Submit/propagate adapter for the claim-type assumption verify round-trip: `submit` maps the assumption onto the unchanged cogni-claims `EntityRef` object contract and appends an `unverified` ClaimRecord under a mkdir lock (idempotent — one assumption, one record); `propagate` writes `status: "verified"` + `citation.claim_id` back onto the assumption record, refusing unless the referenced ClaimRecord is itself verified |
| `assumption-change-frequency.sh` | Read-only retrospective spike (bash exec-delegator over a stdlib-only python3 miner): mines the git history of a deliverable corpus and reports how often bare numeric literals changed (`edits_per_literal` over the observed window). Registry-independent — reads git history, not `assumptions.json` — so it sizes the payoff of the propagation automation before that automation exists. Compares each commit's full-file literal counts against the previous version (not diff fragments), so frontmatter and code-fence boundaries are detected exactly |
| `discover-projects.sh` | Thin wrapper delegating to `cogni-workspace/scripts/discover-plugin-projects.sh` (registry: `$HOME/.claude/cogni-consult-projects.json`) |
| `_discover_extractor.py` | Per-engagement JSON field extractor consumed by the discovery wrapper (reads the flat consult-project.json schema) |

All scripts use JSON output: `{"success": bool, "data": {...}, "error": "string"}`.
All scripts are stdlib-only (bash + python3, no pip dependencies).

## Key Conventions

- Engagement and entity slugs in kebab-case, derived from names
- Workflow state per deliverable: `pending` → `in-progress` → `complete` (→ `in-progress` on iteration re-entry); stored only in `field.json`, field and engagement completion derived at read time
- `dt_stage` tracks the design-thinking stage per deliverable (`empathize`/`define`/`ideate`/`prototype`/`test`)
- `personas_gate` is a **derived** rollup (never stored): `engagement-status.sh` computes it at read time from the `personas/` directory — **satisfied** when any `personas/*.json` carries `source: scope-seeded` or the extensionless `personas/.gate-waiver` marker exists, else **pending**. It gates the first design-thinking deliverable (seed personas from scope, or take the defaults-only waiver, before deliverable work starts)
- Entity outputs are Obsidian-browsable markdown with YAML frontmatter; state files are plain JSON
- `language` field in consult-project.json is the deliverable/output language for artifacts (technical terms stay English); the user-facing interaction language is a separate, runtime-derived axis (workspace default + message-detection override, never stored) — see `references/interaction-language.md`
- **Research routing**: every research run goes through the engagement's bound knowledge base per `references/research-routing.md` — the canonical rule all deliverable-producing skills point at (binding via `plugin_refs.knowledge_base`, pipeline rungs, depth framing, syntheses copied to `action-fields/<field-slug>/research/<topic-slug>.md`); raw WebSearch only for a single trivial fact-check
- **Publish seam**: `consult-publish` is the consultant-elected, never-auto-firing path that turns a completed deliverable into a presentation-ready brief. It appends one `{format, brief_path, route_steps, source_deliverable, published_at}` entry per published format to the deliverable's `publish[]` array in `field.json` (`format` ∈ `{slides, web-poster, report, infographic}`); `brief_path` is a **path reference** to the produced brief — never copied content, mirroring the source-lineage discipline so an upstream correction stays visible downstream, and `engagement-status.sh` passes the array through verbatim (no script change). Rendering and brand are out of scope: cogni-consult emits the brief, Claude Design (claude.ai/design) renders it. Every format builds a consult-native brief, so the standard path never requires `cogni-visual` (it remains an opt-in local-render fallback only); the optional `cogni-copywriting` polish step is skipped when absent. Canonical routing contract: `references/publish-routing.md`; `publish[]` schema: `references/data-model.md`
