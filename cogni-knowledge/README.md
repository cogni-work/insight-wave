# cogni-knowledge

> **Preview** (v0.x) — core skills defined but may change. Feedback welcome.

> **insight-wave readiness (Claude Code desktop)** — Claude Code desktop is the recommended interface for insight-wave today. Cowork is a secondary path and is not yet production-ready for insight-wave workflows because of context-window and Pencil-MCP fidelity gaps — see the [deployment guide](../docs/deployment-guide.md) for detail. This guidance will flip when those gaps close upstream.

> **Start here.** Run `/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-resume` for project status and next-step guidance — whether you're starting fresh or returning to an in-progress project.

**Wiki-first research that compounds.** Every shipped deep-research tool today produces a document and loses the underlying knowledge to chat history. cogni-knowledge inverts that posture: a research run *binds* to a named knowledge base, deposits its findings into a persistent cogni-wiki, and the next run reads from the same wiki before going to the web. Knowledge gets denser with every project — instead of starting from zero each time.

This plugin is a thin orchestrator over `cogni-wiki`. The v0.1.0 inverted pipeline forks the agents it needs locally (so the runtime path is 0% cogni-research), and the only new state cogni-knowledge owns is a `binding.json` that records "this wiki is the knowledge base for topic area X, and these research projects have contributed to it."

## Why this exists

| Problem | One-shot research tools | cogni-knowledge |
|---|---|---|
| Where do findings go after the report ships? | Lost to chat history | Filed in a persistent wiki |
| Second research run on a related topic | Starts from zero | Reads the wiki first |
| Cross-project synthesis | Manual; copy-paste between sessions | Automatic — wiki accumulates and interlinks |
| Provenance of a stale fact | Forgotten by next session | `derived_from_research: <slug>` traces every page back to the run that filed it |
| Refresh stale claims | Manual re-research | `knowledge-refresh` (push: re-research stale topics; pull: re-deposit from a new project) |

## What it is

**IS:** A binding orchestrator that turns `cogni-wiki` into a wiki-first research workflow. A knowledge base = one cogni-wiki + a `binding.json` manifest. Every inverted-pipeline run deposits a verified synthesis into that wiki and is recorded in the binding; the next run reads what previous runs filed before going to the web.

**DOES:** the v0.1.0 inverted pipeline — `knowledge-plan` → `knowledge-curate` → `knowledge-fetch` → `knowledge-ingest` → `knowledge-distill` (Phase 4.5, optional) → `knowledge-compose` → `knowledge-verify` → `knowledge-finalize` — plus the read-side skills (`knowledge-setup`, `knowledge-resume`, `knowledge-query`, `knowledge-dashboard`, `knowledge-refresh`) and stdlib scripts (`knowledge-binding.py`, `cycle-guard.py`, `fetch-cache.py`, `candidate-store.py`, `citation-store.py`, `concept-store.py`, `pipeline-summary.py`, `verify-store.py`, `wiki-coverage.py`). Sources are fetched once before composition; **`knowledge-distill` deduplicates claims and grows a `concept`/`entity` web that successive runs enrich rather than duplicate** (the compounding mechanism, #336); every citation is verified against pre-extracted source claims (zero network); `knowledge-finalize` closes the loop by depositing a synthesis a future run can read. The legacy v0.0.x research+report chain is archived under `_archive/`.

**MEANS for you:** the work compounds. Run research on EU AI Act Article 6 today; tomorrow's run on foundation-model obligations reads what you already filed. Query the base by slug with `knowledge-query`; visualize it with `knowledge-dashboard`; keep it fresh with `knowledge-refresh`. No vector store, no embeddings — just markdown that compounds.

## What it does

1. **Setup** a knowledge base — one cogni-wiki + a `binding.json` manifest that records every research project deposited
2. **Plan** a topic into 3–7 sub-questions with per-sub-question candidate domains (no web yet) — Phase 1 of the v0.1.0 inverted pipeline
3. **Curate** candidate sources per sub-question via WebSearch + scoring, then fetch each survivor's body via WebFetch into a shared fetch-cache (Option B — the fetch rides the parallel curators) — Phase 2
4. **Fetch** assembles the fetch-manifest from the curators' results; cobrowse recovery of WebFetch misses via the `claude-in-chrome` extension is opt-in (`--cobrowse`) — Phase 3
5. **Ingest** fetched sources into the wiki as `type: source` pages with `pre_extracted_claims:` frontmatter — Phase 4 (the wiki populated before any draft runs)
6. **Distill** the source claims into `type: concept` / `type: entity` pages that successive runs enrich (claims appended, source backlinks unioned) instead of duplicating, with deterministic **claim-level dedup** at deposit — Phase 4.5 (optional, fail-soft; the compounding mechanism, #336)
7. **Compose** the draft report by reading the populated wiki (concept/entity pages as framing *and* citable cross-source evidence — #344), with clickable numbered `[N]` inline citations (localized per the project's `output_language`) + a parallel citation manifest; `[[sources/<slug>]]` wikilinks are confined to the reference list — Phase 5
8. **Verify** every cited claim against the cited page's `pre_extracted_claims` (zero network) and loop with the revisor on `unsupported` deviations, capped at 2 iterations — Phase 6
9. **Finalize** the verified draft as `wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md` with `type: synthesis` + `derived_from_research:` lineage, refuse self-citing loops via `cycle-guard.py` (now with a citation-manifest fallback), update the wiki index + entries_count + context_brief, and append the project to the binding — Phase 7 (closes the inverted-pipeline loop)
10. **Resume** project status — deposited projects, wiki health, suggested next action
11. **Query** the bound base — natural-language question routed through `cogni-wiki:wiki-query`
12. **Dashboard** the bound base — HTML overview with a binding overlay sidecar
13. **Refresh** stale pages — pull-mode pipes a research project in; push-mode re-runs the inverted pipeline on stale topics

See `references/absorption-roadmap.md` for the v0.1.0 inverted-pipeline plan (M1–M11 shipped; M12 alpha re-run + v0.1.0 bump pending). The legacy v0.0.x `knowledge-research` / `knowledge-report` chain is archived under `_archive/` — see `_archive/README.md`.

> **Note**: cogni-knowledge orchestrates `cogni-wiki`. The v0.1.0 inverted pipeline forks the agents it needs locally, so the runtime path is 0% cogni-research. The legacy v0.0.x chain that delegated to cogni-research is archived under `_archive/`.

## Quick start

```
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-resume --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act  # ← entry point: status + next step
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-setup --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --knowledge-title "EU AI Act knowledge base"
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-plan --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --topic "EU AI Act Article 6 high-risk systems"
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-curate --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --project-path ...
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-fetch --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --project-path ...
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-ingest --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --project-path ...
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-compose --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --project-path ...
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-verify --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --project-path ...
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-dashboard --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --open yes
/cogni-knowledge:knowledge-query --knowledge-slug eu-ai-act --question "what does the wiki say about foundation models?"
```

Or just describe what you want in natural language:

- "Set up a new knowledge base for EU AI Act compliance"
- "Plan a research project on Article 6 high-risk systems"
- "What does my wiki say about foundation model obligations?"
- "Show me the dashboard for the EU AI Act knowledge base"
- "Refresh the stale pages in my wiki"

The second project reads the wiki the first one deposited — that is the compounding loop. The `dashboard` and `query` skills let you inspect and ask the accumulated base. Use `knowledge-refresh --mode push|pull` later to keep stale pages fresh.

## Data model

One new artifact: `<knowledge-base>/.cogni-knowledge/binding.json`, sibling to the wiki's `.cogni-wiki/config.json`. It records:

- `knowledge_slug`, `knowledge_title`
- `wiki_path` — absolute path to the bound cogni-wiki (the wiki's own slug is read live from `<wiki_path>/.cogni-wiki/config.json` so it cannot drift)
- `research_projects[]` — one entry per deposited run: `slug`, `deposited_at`, `report_path`, `report_source`
- `topic_lineage` — `covered_themes[]` and `open_themes[]` (populated as the base grows)

All other state lives upstream: wiki pages in `cogni-wiki`, research artifacts in `cogni-research-<slug>/`. cogni-knowledge owns nothing else.

## How it works

```
knowledge-setup
  → cogni-wiki:wiki-setup (creates the wiki)
  → knowledge-binding.py --init (writes binding.json)

inverted pipeline (knowledge-plan → … → knowledge-finalize) --knowledge-slug X --topic T
  → knowledge-plan      decompose T into 3–7 sub-questions → plan.json
  → knowledge-curate    wiki-coverage.py (read-before-web: which sub-questions the wiki already covers) → source-curator per sub-question (narrowed WebSearch + score + WebFetch bodies → shared fetch-cache) → candidates.json
  → knowledge-fetch     build fetch-manifest.json from the curators' results; opt-in cobrowse reconcile of WebFetch misses
  → knowledge-ingest    source-ingester writes wiki/sources/<slug>.md with pre_extracted_claims:
  → knowledge-distill   (optional) concept-distiller proposes → concept-store.py merges wiki/{concepts,entities}/<slug>.md (claim-dedup, enriched across runs)
  → knowledge-compose   wiki-composer reads the populated wiki (concepts as framing + citable evidence) → draft-vN.md + citation-manifest.json
  → knowledge-verify    wiki-verifier scores citations vs pre_extracted_claims / distilled_claims (zero network); revisor loop on unsupported
  → knowledge-finalize  cycle-guard.py → wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md (derived_from_research:) → index/entries_count/context_brief → knowledge-binding.py --append-project; advisory tripwires: wiki-contradictor (#335) + wiki-reviewer structural score (#309 P1.1)

knowledge-query --knowledge-slug X --question Q
  → cogni-wiki:wiki-query --question Q  (against the bound wiki)
  → footer: knowledge base + deposit count

knowledge-dashboard --knowledge-slug X
  → cogni-wiki:wiki-dashboard --wiki-root <bound>  (writes wiki-dashboard.html)
  → writes knowledge-overlay.md sidecar  (binding view: deposits + lint claim_drift)

knowledge-refresh --knowledge-slug X --mode pull --from-research S
  → cogni-wiki:wiki-refresh --from-research S --wiki-root <bound>

knowledge-refresh --knowledge-slug X --mode push
  → cogni-wiki:wiki-lint --wiki-root <bound>  (find stale_page / stale_draft)
  → multi-select + batch confirm  (which topics, then yes/no to launch)
  → per selected topic, sequentially: the seven-phase inverted pipeline
       knowledge-plan → knowledge-curate → knowledge-fetch → knowledge-ingest
         → knowledge-distill (optional) → knowledge-compose → knowledge-verify → knowledge-finalize
```

The deposited synthesis pages are now part of the wiki and visible to the next `knowledge-compose` run, which reads `wiki/syntheses/*.md` as prior cross-source framing — the compounding loop.

## Components

| Component | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| knowledge-resume | Skill | Show status of a cogni-knowledge base — slug, bound wiki, deposited projects, wiki health, next-step guidance |
| knowledge-setup | Skill | Bootstrap a cogni-knowledge base — wiki + a binding manifest that records every research project deposited |
| knowledge-plan | Skill | Phase 1 of the v0.1.0 inverted pipeline — decompose a topic into 3–7 sub-questions with candidate domains + a thematic `theme_label` per sub-question |
| knowledge-curate | Skill | Phase 2 — resolve wiki coverage once (`wiki-coverage.py`, read-before-web #309) then fan out one `source-curator` per sub-question (WebSearch + score + WebFetch bodies); merge candidates (each with a `fetch` sub-object) into `candidates.json` |
| knowledge-fetch | Skill | Phase 3 — build `fetch-manifest.json` from the curators' fetch results; opt-in (`--cobrowse`) `source-fetcher` reconcile of WebFetch misses |
| knowledge-ingest | Skill | Phase 4 — per-source `source-ingester` writes `wiki/sources/<slug>.md` with `pre_extracted_claims` frontmatter; writes curated backlinks (`backlink_audit.py --apply-plan`) and files each source under its sub-question's thematic index category |
| knowledge-distill | Skill | Phase 4.5 (optional, fail-soft, #336) — `concept-distiller` proposes recurring `concept`/`entity` pages; `concept-store.py` create-or-merges them under a lock with **claim-level dedup**, so successive runs enrich the concept web rather than duplicate it (the compounding mechanism); an optional cross-lingual pass merges DE↔EN twin claims on mixed-language bases (#345) |
| knowledge-compose | Skill | Phase 5 — `wiki-composer` reads the populated wiki (concept/entity pages as framing *and* citable cross-source evidence — #344) and emits `draft-vN.md` + a `[[sources/<slug>]]` citation manifest |
| knowledge-verify | Skill | Phase 6 — zero-network claim alignment, fanned out across parallel `wiki-verifier` shards (`verify-store.py`) + revisor loop on `unsupported` deviations (max 2 iterations) |
| knowledge-finalize | Skill | Phase 7 — deposit the verified draft as `wiki/syntheses/<slug>.md` with `derived_from_research:` lineage + bare `[[<slug>]]` reference backlinks; cycle-guard, index update, entries_count bump, context_brief rebuild, binding append, then a `wiki-lint --fix=all` + `wiki-health` conformance gate (closes the inverted-pipeline loop) |
| knowledge-query | Skill | Ask a question against the bound base — natural-language query routed through `cogni-wiki:wiki-query` |
| knowledge-dashboard | Skill | Render an HTML overview with a `knowledge-overlay.md` sidecar listing deposited projects + lint claim_drift |
| knowledge-refresh | Skill | Self-healing — pull-mode pipes a research project in; push-mode auto-researches stale topics |
| source-curator | Agent | Phase 2 fork — reads its sub-question's wiki-coverage verdict and narrows search on already-covered topics (read-before-web #309); per-sub-question WebSearch + scoring + Phase-4 WebFetch body-pull (incl. the PDF Read-loop) through `fetch-cache.py`; emits a batch JSON array (each candidate carries a `fetch` sub-object) |
| source-fetcher | Agent | Phase 3 NEW — cobrowse-only recovery of WebFetch misses via the `claude-in-chrome` extension; reads/writes through `fetch-cache.py` |
| claim-extractor | Agent | Phase 4 fork — reads one cached source body + sub-question refs, emits a JSON array of `{id, text, excerpt_quote, …}` |
| source-ingester | Agent | Phase 4 NEW — reads cached body, dispatches `claim-extractor`, writes `wiki/sources/<slug>.md` atomically |
| concept-distiller | Agent | Phase 4.5 NEW (#336) — reads the run's source-claim bundle + an existing-slug index, clusters recurring facts into `concept`/`entity`/`summary`/`learning` proposals, writes a raw-text records file (never builds JSON/YAML, never computes slugs, never decides dedup) |
| concept-summary-narrator | Agent | Phase 4.5 Step 6.7 NEW (#341) — re-narrates the `## Summary` of each updated distilled page from its merged claims so the wiki compounds narratively; raw-text records, touches only the summary block |
| cross-lingual-claim-merger | Agent | Phase 4.5 Step 6.6 NEW (#345) — confirms which script-flagged DE↔EN candidate pairs are the same fact in two languages; raw-text `merge:` records the orchestrator applies via `concept-store.py crossmerge` (may only confirm, never invents a merge) |
| wiki-composer | Agent | Phase 5 fork — reads wiki pages + prior syntheses, writes `draft-vN.md` with clickable numbered `[N]` citations (localized per `output_language`) plus a raw-text citation-records file the orchestrator serializes into the manifest via `citation-store.py` (#325) |
| wiki-verifier | Agent | Phase 6 NEW — scores each citation's verbatim `draft_sentence` as `verbatim` / `paraphrase` / `unsupported` / `synthesis` (zero network, never re-tokenizes; shardable via `CITATIONS_PATH`) |
| revisor | Agent | Phase 6 fork — re-points unsupported sentences to a covering on-page claim before dropping the citation (no new fetches) |
| wiki-contradictor | Agent | Phase 7 Step 10.6 NEW (#335) — zero-network scorer comparing the just-deposited synthesis against each cited source's claims; emits a `contradictor-vN.json` observability report (no auto-resolution) |
| wiki-reviewer | Agent | Phase 7 Step 10.7 NEW (#309 P1.1) — zero-network structural-quality scorer (ported from `cogni-research`'s reviewer) rating the draft on 5 weighted dimensions (completeness/coherence/source-diversity/depth/clarity) with a citation-density gate; emits an advisory `structural-review-vN.json` (no auto-fix, never blocks) |

```

The plugin sits between the user and `cogni-wiki`. On the v0.1.0 inverted pipeline (Phases 1–7 shipped), the runtime path is 0% `cogni-research` — forked agents under `agents/` are point-in-time copies and the bound wiki is the only evidence source for composition, verification, and finalization. The legacy v0.0.x chain (`knowledge-research` / `knowledge-report`) that delegated to `cogni-research` is archived under `_archive/`.

## Dependencies

- `cogni-wiki` ≥ 0.0.44 (Phase 4 `knowledge-ingest` needs the `type: source` allowlist added to `wiki-lint` / `wiki-health` at 0.0.44; `knowledge-query` uses the `--wiki-root` flag from 0.0.41)
- `cogni-workspace` — provides the market registry, read via `cogni-workspace/scripts/get-market-config.py` for localized (bilingual + per-market authority) search. `knowledge-curate` resolves the market config **once** in skill context and threads it to its `source-curator` agents (#304, v0.1.5) — when a market is configured it **fails loudly** if the config can't be resolved or resolves to the unlocalized `_default`, rather than silently degrading per-curator. `knowledge-plan` reads the same helper for its candidate-domain suggestions.
- `cogni-research` — **not a runtime dependency** of the v0.1.0 inverted pipeline (forked agents are local point-in-time copies). The archived v0.0.x chain under `_archive/` delegated to it; it remains available as a sibling plugin for one-shot reports.

## Custom development

Adding a skill: every skill delegates. If you find yourself writing a new agent or duplicating cogni-wiki/cogni-research logic, the right answer is almost always to push the change upstream and re-delegate. See `references/delegation-contract.md` for the contract.
