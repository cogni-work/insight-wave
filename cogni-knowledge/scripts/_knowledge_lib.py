"""
_knowledge_lib.py — shared primitives for cogni-knowledge scripts.

Single source of truth for URL identity in the v0.1.0 inverted pipeline.
`candidate-store.py` (curator-side merge into `candidates.json`) and
`fetch-cache.py` (fetcher-side cache lookup keyed by `sha256(normalize_url(url))`)
must agree byte-for-byte on the canonical form of any URL — otherwise the
curator-side dedup and the fetch-cache hit/miss decision drift, and a URL
present in `candidates.json` can silently miss in the cache (or vice versa).

Before this module existed, `normalize_url` + the `_STRIP_QUERY_*` constants
+ the `tempfile.mkstemp + os.replace` atomic-write pattern were duplicated
across both scripts. The copies had already started style-drifting on
`normalize_url`. The deferred extraction was originally scheduled for M5
(`source-ingester` as a third caller); landed early at v0.0.18 to close
the divergence before it became behavioural.

`knowledge-binding.py:_write_binding` shares the same atomic-write pattern
but a different signature (takes `knowledge_root`, resolves the binding
path internally). Not extracted here — possible follow-up.

stdlib-only. Python 3.8+.
