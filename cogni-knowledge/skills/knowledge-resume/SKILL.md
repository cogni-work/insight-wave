# Knowledge Resume

Give the user a fast, grounded status view of a cogni-knowledge base so they know what is inside and what the right next action is. This skill is **read-only** with respect to the binding and the wiki — it never writes. The only side effect is that the native `health.py` invocation appends its health-check log line to `wiki/log.md` (the same side effect the old `cogni-wiki:wiki-resume` dispatch produced — unchanged).

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/delegation-contract.md` once at the start of a session so you remember the wiki-engine boundary — cogni-knowledge computes the wiki health verdict on the **vendored** wiki-health engine (resolved vendored-first), it does not dispatch `cogni-wiki:wiki-resume`.

## When to run

- User asks for status, overview, or "where was I" on a knowledge base
- User returns after a gap and wants orientation
- Right after `knowledge-setup` or a `knowledge-finalize` run finished, to confirm the deposit and suggest the next step
- Proactively when a session opens in a directory containing `.cogni-knowledge/binding.json`

## Never run when

- The target directory has no `.cogni-knowledge/binding.json` — offer `knowledge-setup` instead.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--knowledge-slug` | Yes | Slug of the knowledge base to resume. Resolves to `cogni-knowledge/<slug>/` unless `--knowledge-root` overrides. |
| `--knowledge-root` | No | Override the default knowledge-base directory. |
| `--verbose` | No | Includes the last 10 `wiki/log.md` entries verbatim (default: last 3). |

## Workflow

### 0. Pre-flight

**Required engine.** This skill computes the wiki health verdict on the **vendored** wiki-health engine — cogni-knowledge ships a byte-identical copy in-tree under `scripts/vendor/cogni-wiki/`, so a bound base shows its resume status without cogni-wiki installed and this skill no longer dispatches `cogni-wiki:wiki-resume`, mirroring the native posture of `knowledge-dashboard` and `knowledge-query`. It reads the inverted-pipeline manifests via `pipeline-summary.py` and never reaches cogni-research. The `cogni-wiki` install is only a fallback layout. Probe both so the skill aborts cleanly here rather than failing mid-skill:

```
# vendored-first: the in-tree wiki-health scripts are self-contained
test -d "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/vendor/cogni-wiki/skills/wiki-health/scripts" && WIKI_OK=yes || WIKI_OK=no

# fallback: an installed cogni-wiki sibling / marketplace cache (legacy layout)
if [ "$WIKI_OK" = "no" ]; then
  probe_plugin() {
    local plugin="$1" skill="$2"
    test -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../${plugin}/skills/${skill}/SKILL.md" && return 0
    for d in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../${plugin}/"*/skills/"${skill}"/SKILL.md; do
      [ -f "$d" ] && return 0
    done
    return 1
  }
  probe_plugin cogni-wiki wiki-setup && WIKI_OK=yes || WIKI_OK=no
fi
```

If `WIKI_OK` is `no`, abort:

> cogni-knowledge's vendored wiki-health scripts are missing and no `cogni-wiki`
> install was found. Reinstall cogni-knowledge, then retry.

Resume is read-only with respect to disk; the vendored-first probe gives the user the same clean signal every other `knowledge-*` read/render skill emits. This probe is the early-abort gate only — Step 2's `resolve_wiki_scripts` is the authoritative resolver for the actual `health.py` path; keep the two vendored-first precedences in sync.

### 1. Resolve the knowledge root and read the binding

1. Resolve `knowledge_root`:
   - If `--knowledge-root` is set, use it.
   - Otherwise, `knowledge_root = cogni-knowledge/<knowledge-slug>/` (relative to the current working directory).

2. Read the binding:
   ```
   python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/knowledge-binding.py read \
       --knowledge-root <knowledge_root>
   ```
   On `success: false`, abort and offer `knowledge-setup`. Do not auto-create.

3. Extract from the binding: `knowledge_slug`, `knowledge_title`, `wiki_path`, `research_projects[]`, `created`, and the charter (`binding.get("charter", {}).get("domain"/"audience"/"scope", "")` — schema 0.1.4; the `.get` chain falls through to `""` on a pre-0.1.4 binding, read-only fail-soft). (The bound wiki's own slug, if needed for display, comes live from `<wiki_path>/.cogni-wiki/config.json` — never cached in the binding.)

   Then read the topic lineage for display via the `themes` subcommand (don't render `open_themes[]` from the raw binding — a researched seed is never pruned out of it; `themes` partitions it against `covered_themes[]` at read time):
   ```
   python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/knowledge-binding.py themes \
       --knowledge-root <knowledge_root>
   ```
   Capture `open_active` (still-open seeds, researched ones already dropped) and `covered` (each `{label, question_slug}`, where `label` is already the `labels[0]`-with-`question_slug`-fallback render). Read-only and fail-soft (structurally-invalid / pre-0.1.4 binding → empty lists, `success: true`).

4. Validate the binding's `knowledge_slug` matches `--knowledge-slug`. Mismatch → abort.

### 2. Compute the wiki status natively (vendored `health.py` + direct reads)

Resolve the vendored `wiki-health` scripts dir vendored-first (the same `resolve_wiki_scripts` posture `knowledge-dashboard` / `knowledge-ingest` use), then invoke `health.py` directly — no `Skill` dispatch:

```bash
. "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-wiki-scripts.sh"
WIKI_HEALTH_SCRIPTS=$(resolve_wiki_scripts wiki-health health.py) \
  || abort "cogni-wiki wiki-health scripts not found (vendored copy missing)"
```

**2a. Health verdict.** Run the vendored `health.py` against the bound wiki (it resolves `_wikilib` itself; read-only apart from the health-check log line it appends — the same side effect the old dispatch produced):

```bash
python3 "${WIKI_HEALTH_SCRIPTS}/health.py" --wiki-root "<wiki_path>"
```

Parse the JSON envelope and capture `data.errors`, `data.warnings`, and `data.stats` (`entries_count_actual`, `entries_count_drift`, `claim_drift_count`). The one-line verdict for Step 3 is **OK** when `errors` is empty, else `N issues — <first error class(es)>`; surface `entries_count_drift` / `claim_drift_count` as warnings when non-zero. Also scan `data.warnings[]` for the structural-drift finding classes the detect child emits — `structural_drift` (a curated front-door region, the `OVERVIEW-NARRATIVE` placeholder or an empty `ROOT-LINKS` sentinel, left unpopulated on a `>= 0.0.8` base) and `schema_version_lag` (config `schema_version` trails the engine's current schema) — and capture whether either class is present. These are **warnings, not errors**, so a drifted `>= 0.0.8` base still reads a bare **OK** verdict; the Step 3 repair branch therefore keys on the captured class, not on the verdict. Fail-soft: an absent or unparseable `warnings[]` leaves both flags unset and the repair branch is skipped (never block resume on a warnings read — the parallel of the `schema_version` fail-soft posture below). On `success: false` (e.g. `<wiki_path>/.cogni-wiki/config.json` absent), surface the error and still print the binding section per Edge cases.

**2b. Context brief + recent log (direct reads).** Read the wiki's own orientation surfaces directly — both fail-soft (a missing file is omitted, never an abort). Resolve each path through the control-file resolver (legacy `wiki/<file>` today, `wiki/meta/<file>` once the layout flip lands — prefers `wiki/meta/` when present) rather than hardcoding it:

- `CONTEXT_BRIEF=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/control-path.py" context-brief --wiki-root "<wiki_path>")`, then `Read "$CONTEXT_BRIEF"` (auto-rebuilt by ingest/finalize) for the one-paragraph summary.
- `LOG_PATH=$(python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/control-path.py" log --wiki-root "<wiki_path>")`, then `Read "$LOG_PATH"` for recent activity — show the **last 3** lines by default, the **last 10** when `--verbose` is set.
- Entry count comes from `<wiki_path>/.cogni-wiki/config.json` (`entries_count`), cross-checked against `data.stats.entries_count_actual` from 2a. Capture `schema_version` from the same config read — the Step 3 decision tree branches on it (`health.py` does not surface it).

For each deposited project (cap at 5, newest first), read its inverted-pipeline depth so the summary shows how far each project got, not just that it exists:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pipeline-summary.py project \
    --project-path <research_projects[i].project_path>
```

Capture `sub_questions`, `fetched`, `phase_reached`, and the distill fields `concepts_total` / `claims_attached` / `claims_deduped`. Legacy deposits (no `.metadata/` manifests) return zeros + `phase_reached: "none"` — render their depth as `(legacy deposit)` rather than `0 sub-questions`. Then read the knowledge-base-global fetch-cache verdict once:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pipeline-summary.py cache-health \
    --knowledge-root <knowledge_root>
```

Capture `verdict` (and `entries`).

### 3. Compose the cogni-knowledge summary

Print a ≤ 12-line summary that layers the binding onto the wiki status:

- **Knowledge base.** `<knowledge_title>` (`<knowledge_slug>`), created `<created>`
- **Charter.** When `charter.domain` is non-empty (schema 0.1.4): `<charter.domain> · for <charter.audience> · scope <charter.scope>`. Omit the line entirely on a pre-0.1.4 / unframed base. When the charter is set, append a one-line read-only re-steer offer beneath it: *"Re-steering the base? Run `knowledge-setup --reframe --knowledge-slug <slug>`."* This is a **suggestion only** — resume stays read-only (the re-frame write lives in `knowledge-setup`, never here).
- **Wiki path.** `<wiki_path>` — wiki health verdict from Step 2a (one line: "OK" / "N issues — <first error class(es)>"; append a `· entries drift <±N>` / `· claim drift <N>` note when those stats are non-zero, and a `· structural drift` / `· schema lag` note when the Step 2a `structural_drift` / `schema_version_lag` warning class is present — paralleling the drift suffixes so a degraded front door is visible even when the verdict is a bare "OK")
- **Deposited research projects.** `<count>` — one line per project (newest first, cap 5, "and N more" for the rest), each as: `<slug> — <sub_questions> sub-questions · <fetched> fetched · phase <phase_reached>` + ` · <concepts_total> concepts (<claims_deduped>/<claims_attached> claims deduped)` when `concepts_total > 0` (the Phase-4.5 distill compounding signal) + `· synthesis ✓` when the binding entry's `report_source == "wiki"` + ` (<deposited_at>)`. Legacy deposits show `<slug> — (legacy deposit) (<deposited_at>)`.
- **Pipeline status.** Knowledge-base-global fetch-cache (one shared cache across all projects): one line by `verdict` — `healthy` → `fetch-cache healthy (<entries> sources)`; `stale` → `fetch-cache stale — re-run knowledge-curate to re-fetch aged sources (or knowledge-refresh to re-run the pipeline on stale topics)`; `empty` → `fetch-cache empty — run knowledge-plan first`.
- **Topic lineage.** Use the `themes` subcommand output from Step 1. If `covered` or `open_active` is non-empty, print them as two short lists: render the **covered** list from `covered[]` (each entry's `label` — already the `labels[0]`-with-`question_slug`-fallback render; never the raw object or the `theme_key`), and the **open** list from `open_active` (plain strings — the still-open seeds, with researched seeds already dropped off so the backlog tracks reality). Else omit.
- **Next action.** One line, selected by the decision tree below.

The Step 2 health detail (the verdict line plus any `errors`/`warnings` worth surfacing, the context-brief summary, and the recent-log lines) appears above the summary so the user has the structural detail at hand; cogni-knowledge's contribution is the binding overlay.

#### Next action — recommend by pipeline phase

Pick the **one** Next-action line to print by branching on workflow state, not by reading out a fixed sequence. The state field is each project's `phase_reached` from `pipeline-summary.py project` (`none` → `plan` → `curate` → `fetch` → `ingest` → `distill` → `compose` → `verify`); a finalized project has `report_source == "wiki"` in its binding entry (the `· synthesis ✓` marker). Evaluate top to bottom and stop at the first match:

- **Wiki has structural issues** (Step 2a verdict ≠ OK): "Fix the structural issues first — see the health detail above; run `knowledge-lint --fix=all` to repair the mechanical drift classes (a separate operator-invoked write step — resume never auto-fixes), or `knowledge-health` for a deeper read-only structural verdict. Then resume the pipeline, or `knowledge-query --knowledge-slug <slug> --question '...'` to ask what the base already knows."
- **Base predates the curated layout** (Step 2b `schema_version < 0.0.8` — compare as dotted integer tuples, e.g. `(0,0,10) > (0,0,8)`, never as strings): "Migrate this base to the curated layout — run `knowledge-index --migrate --knowledge-slug <slug>` (dry-run preview first; add `--apply` to execute). Control files move under `wiki/meta/`, the overview folds into the index intro, and the flat root splits into root-map + per-type sub-indexes." Suggestion only — resume never runs the migration (the write lives in `knowledge-index`, mirroring the charter re-steer posture). A missing or unparseable `schema_version` skips this branch (never block resume on a version read — the parallel of the existing fail-soft posture).
- **Curated front door has drifted** (Step 2b `schema_version >= 0.0.8` AND Step 2a flagged a `structural_drift` or `schema_version_lag` warning class): "Regenerate the drifted front-door regions — run `knowledge-index --repair --knowledge-slug <slug>` (dry-run preview first; add `--apply` to execute). It re-renders the theme-scoped ROOT-LINKS / overview-narrative regions the curated layout expects and reconciles a lagging `schema_version` to the engine's current schema." Suggestion only — resume never runs the repair (the write lives in `knowledge-index`, mirroring the migrate / charter re-steer posture). A missing or unparseable drift class skips this branch (never block resume on a warnings read — the parallel of the `schema_version` fail-soft posture above). Mutually exclusive with the `< 0.0.8` migrate nudge above: that branch fires on the pre-curated floor, this one on a curated-but-drifted base.
- **No projects** (`research_projects` empty): "Run the inverted pipeline — `knowledge-plan --knowledge-slug <slug> --topic '...'`, then `knowledge-curate` → `knowledge-fetch` → `knowledge-ingest` → `knowledge-distill` → `knowledge-compose` → `knowledge-verify` → `knowledge-finalize` — to deposit your first project."

Otherwise branch on the newest in-flight project's `phase_reached` (the deepest phase that ran but did not finalize) — one recommendation per state:

| `phase_reached` | Recommend |
|---|---|
| `none` (legacy deposit, no `.metadata/`) | Re-run from `knowledge-plan` — the project predates the inverted pipeline and has no resumable state. |
| `plan` | `knowledge-curate` — sources are planned but not yet discovered/fetched. |
| `curate` | `knowledge-fetch` — candidates scored; build the fetch manifest (add `--cobrowse` to recover WebFetch misses). |
| `fetch` | `knowledge-ingest` — bodies fetched; deposit per-source wiki pages with extracted claims. |
| `ingest` | `knowledge-distill` (optional Phase 4.5 — compounds concepts/entities), then `knowledge-compose`. |
| `distill` | `knowledge-compose` — distillation done; draft the synthesis from the populated wiki. |
| `compose` | `knowledge-verify` — draft + citation manifest exist; run the zero-network claim check. |
| `verify` | `knowledge-finalize` — verified; deposit the synthesis into `wiki/syntheses/` and close the loop. |

- **All projects finalized** (every entry `report_source == "wiki"`, none in flight): the base is compounding — "Ask it with `knowledge-query --knowledge-slug <slug> --question '...'`, render an overview with `knowledge-dashboard`, run the semantic hygiene pass with `knowledge-lint`, refresh stale topics with `knowledge-refresh`, deposit a single source straight into the base with `knowledge-ingest-source`, or start a new project with `knowledge-plan` to keep accumulating."

## Edge cases

- **Binding exists but `wiki_path` no longer does.** Step 1(4) catches the missing `.cogni-wiki/config.json`. Abort with a clear message.
- **`health.py` fails.** Surface its error and still print the binding section — the user benefits from at least knowing the deposit count even if the wiki health check is broken.
- **`research_projects[]` references a `report_path` that no longer exists.** Do not abort; flag in the summary with "(report file missing — possibly archived)" next to that entry. The binding is the durable record; the on-disk research project is incidental.
- **`project_path` missing or its `.metadata/` gone (legacy / archived deposit).** `pipeline-summary.py project` returns zeros + `phase_reached: "none"`; render that project's depth as `(legacy deposit)` rather than zeros. Never abort on a per-project read failure — the binding-level line still renders.
- **`pipeline-summary.py cache-health` fails.** Omit the Pipeline status line rather than aborting; the rest of the summary is still useful.

## Out of scope

- Runs the vendored `wiki-health` engine for the verdict, but does NOT run `wiki-lint` — that is a tokenful semantic pass the user invokes deliberately, not on resume.
- Does NOT dispatch `cogni-wiki:wiki-resume` — the health verdict + status surfaces are computed natively (vendored `health.py` + direct reads of `context_brief.md` / `log.md` / `config.json`).
- Does NOT write to the binding or the wiki — read-only (apart from `health.py`'s own health-check log line).

## Output

A status block printed to the user. No files written.
