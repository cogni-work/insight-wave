# Portfolio Messaging Plugin

A portfolio messaging and proposition planning plugin for Claude Code. Helps SMEs build structured, market-specific value propositions using the IS/DOES/MEANS (FAB) framework — from product definition through competitive analysis to export-ready deliverables.

> **Note**: This plugin assists with B2B messaging strategy and portfolio planning. All outputs — especially market sizing, competitive intelligence, and claim verification — should be reviewed by domain experts before use in sales materials, proposals, or strategic decisions.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins add cogni-portfolio
```

## Example Workflows

### Full Portfolio Build

1. Run `/setup` to create a new project and define your company context
2. (Optional) Drop existing documents into `uploads/` and run `/ingest` to import data
3. Run `/products` to define your named offerings
4. Run `/features` to add capabilities per product
5. Run `/markets` to discover and size 3-7 target markets
6. Run `/propositions` to generate IS/DOES/MEANS messaging for all Feature x Market pairs
7. Run `/solutions` to define implementation plans and pricing tiers
8. Run `/compete` to analyze competitors per proposition
8. Run `/customers` to create buyer personas per market
9. Run `/verify` to check research-backed claims against sources
10. Run `/synthesize` to generate the messaging repository
11. Run `/export` to produce proposals, briefs, and workbooks

### Resume Existing Work

1. Run `/resume-portfolio` to detect your current phase and see progress (also detects unprocessed uploads)
2. Follow the recommended next action

### Quick Market Entry Analysis

1. Run `/setup` with a focused product scope
2. Run `/features` to define key capabilities
3. Run `/markets` with web research for validated sizing
4. Run `/propositions` to generate messaging for priority markets
5. Run `/export market-brief` to produce market-specific content

## Data Model

All entities are stored as JSON files in the project directory:

| Entity | Storage | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Project | `portfolio.json` | company name, description, industry |
| Product | `products/{slug}.json` | name, positioning, pricing tier, maturity |
| Feature | `features/{slug}.json` | product_slug, name, description, category |
| Market | `markets/{slug}.json` | name, segmentation, TAM/SAM/SOM |
| Proposition | `propositions/{feature}--{market}.json` | IS/DOES/MEANS statements, evidence |
| Solution | `solutions/{feature}--{market}.json` | implementation phases, pricing tiers (PoV/S/M/L) |
| Competitor | `competitors/{feature}--{market}.json` | name, positioning, strengths, weaknesses |
| Customer | `customers/{market}.json` | role, pain points, buying criteria |

## Dependencies

This plugin works standalone for core messaging workflows. Optional integrations enhance specific capabilities:

- **cogni-claims plugin** — Required for `/verify` (claim verification against cited sources)
- **document-skills plugin** — Required for `/ingest` (docx, pptx, xlsx, pdf extraction) and XLSX export in `/export`

> **Note:** Without these plugins, you can still build the full portfolio through synthesis. Verification and XLSX export will be unavailable.
