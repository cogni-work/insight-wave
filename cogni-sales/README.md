> **insight-wave readiness (Claude Code desktop)** — Claude Code desktop is the recommended interface for insight-wave today. Cowork is a secondary path and is not yet production-ready for insight-wave workflows because of context-window and Pencil-MCP fidelity gaps — see the [deployment guide](../docs/deployment-guide.md) for detail. This guidance will flip when those gaps close upstream.

B2B sales pitch generation using Corporate Visions Why Change methodology. Creates sales presentations and proposals for named customers (deal-specific) or market segments (reusable). Builds on cogni-portfolio data with optional TIPS strategic enrichment. Bilingual DE/EN.

## Why this exists

Generic pitch decks don't win deals. Buyers expect sellers to understand their specific situation — yet building a tailored pitch takes days of research, narrative framing, and slide crafting per opportunity:

| Problem | What happens | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Generic pitches | Same slides for every customer, no industry or account context | Buyers disengage — "you don't understand my business" |
| Manual research | Hours spent finding company news, industry trends, competitive landscape | Outdated by the time the pitch ships |
| Methodology drift | Why Change structure gets diluted without discipline — phases blur, evidence thins | Weaker narrative arc, lower win rates |
| No claim traceability | Market stats and competitor assertions cited without source verification | Credibility risk when buyers check the numbers |

This plugin automates the research-heavy parts of the Corporate Visions Why Change framework — web research, evidence gathering, narrative framing — while keeping strategic judgment with you.

## What it is

A pitch generation pipeline built on the Corporate Visions Why Change methodology. Four research phases — Why Change, Why Now, Why You, Why Pay — each backed by dedicated web research agents that gather company-specific or industry-level evidence. cogni-portfolio provides the product data (propositions, solutions, competitors); cogni-trends optionally enriches with strategic themes. The output is a sales-presentation.md and sales-proposal.md with sequential citations — ready for cogni-visual to render into slides.

## What it does

1. **Setup** — select a portfolio, market, and customer (or segment). Configure language, solution focus, and buying center roles
2. **Why Change** — research the customer's unconsidered needs: industry disruptions, regulatory shifts, competitive pressure. Build the case for why the status quo is unsafe
3. **Why Now** — research urgency drivers: regulatory deadlines, competitive moves, market windows, technology tipping points
4. **Why You** — research differentiation: unique capabilities, competitive gaps, proof points, customer evidence
5. **Why Pay** — research business impact: ROI models, TCO comparisons, risk quantification, value realization timelines
6. **Synthesize** — assemble all phases into a `sales-presentation.md` and `sales-proposal.md` with sequential citations → `sales-presentation.md` + `sales-proposal.md` → story-to-slides, copywriter (presentation deck)
7. **Review** — closed stakeholder loop: buyer, sales director, and marketing director perspectives evaluate the pitch; automated revision if needed (max 2 passes)

## What it means for you

- **Deal-specific in hours, not days.** The researcher agent handles web research, company analysis, and evidence gathering — you review and steer.
- **Methodology-disciplined across 100% of pitches.** Every deck follows all four Why Change phases (Why Change → Why Now → Why You → Why Pay) with proper evidence structure — no phase skipped, no message diluted.
- **Cover both 1:1 and 1:many sales motions without rebuilding the pipeline.** Customer mode researches the named account; segment mode produces a reusable template for any organization in the vertical — one engine, zero duplication effort per new pitch.
- **Claims-verified before you present.** Every factual claim in the deck is registered with a source URL; optional cogni-claims integration verifies all of them in one pass — zero unsourced statistics in front of the customer.
- **Keep multi-day deals moving without rework.** Interrupted pitches resume from the last completed phase — no research lost, no phase reruns, no pipeline stall when a conversation ends mid-workflow.

## Install

Install insight-wave via Claude Code desktop:

- **5-minute walkthrough** — [From Install to Infographic](../docs/workflows/install-to-infographic.md)
- **Full setup reference** — [Claude Code desktop](../docs/claude-code-desktop.md)
- **Enterprise / compliance setup** — [Deployment guide](../docs/deployment-guide.md)

This plugin is part of the [insight-wave ecosystem](../docs/ecosystem-overview.md).

## Quick start

```
/why-change                       # start a new pitch (aliases: /pitch, /sales-pitch, /segment-pitch)
/why-change --project-path <path> # resume an existing pitch
```

Or describe what you want in natural language:

- "Create a Why Change pitch for Siemens Manufacturing"
- "Build a segment pitch for mid-market cloud migration in DACH"
- "Resume the Bechtle pitch"
- "Generate a sales presentation for our IoT portfolio targeting energy utilities"

## Try it

After installing, type one prompt:

> Create a Why Change pitch for a cloud services customer

Claude discovers your portfolio, asks for customer details, then works through all four phases — researching the web, building evidence, and writing narrative prose for each. At the end, you get two deliverables ready for review.

## Data model

Each pitch project tracks state in `pitch-log.json` with pitch mode (customer/segment), workflow phase, buying center roles (economic buyer, technical evaluator, end users, champion), portfolio references, and language config. Per-phase bridge files split structured research (`research.json`) from prose output (`narrative.md`). See [skills/why-change/references/pitch-data-model.md](skills/why-change/references/pitch-data-model.md) for the full schema.
