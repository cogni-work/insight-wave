# cogni-workspace

Workspace-level infrastructure for the cogni plugin ecosystem: theme management, shared conventions, and orchestration utilities.

## Theme Infrastructure

- `pick-theme` is the entry point for theme selection across all plugins
- Themes live in `themes/` as markdown files describing visual identity
- See `references/design-variables-pattern.md` for the shared convention on producing themed HTML dashboards — any skill generating visual HTML output should follow this pattern
